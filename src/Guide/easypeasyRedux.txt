➽ npm i easy-peasy  = to get the easy peasy redux dependency

➽ import { StoreProvider } from "easy-peasy"; 
   import store from "./store";    these 2 lines are added to Index.js

➽ as easy-peasy is used ; datacontext is not used anymore
   but api,axioFetch are still there
   Also new Store.js is there - having all states and actions

➽ execution = Index-> store initialization -> App render and get posts from mock API by useAxiofetch-> components render

➽ navigate()=React Router hook, and hooks cannot be used outside of components.therefore it can not be used in a func in STORE.

➽ store={store} in index , means it tells to consider the states and actions in store.js as STORE

🔺🔴 PERSONAL- BLOG 5  is different from 4 as 4 used DATACONTEXT and in 5; Redux is used .
Therefore the DataContext file is removed in 5 🔺🔴
